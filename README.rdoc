= Perens::InstantUser

Perens::InstantUser is a Rails Engine that makes it as easy as possible to
add user management: logins, authentication, sign-up, etc., to your Rails
application.

* All of the user management services are provided by the Devise gem, but
  we've done most of the *work* that it would otherwise take to install devise.
  The engine provides pre-configured routes and a User model.

* Rails >= 3.1, Devise >= 2.0.0.rc, and Ruby >= 1.9.3 are required.
  It's time to make the jump to
  Ruby 1.9 if you haven't already done so, as Rails 4.0 will require Ruby
  1.9.3 or greater.

* This engine is in a *very* early state of development. 
  There is no inline documentation in the code, and there are no tests!
  But it works, and provides
  a good example of how to use Devise in an engine.

* My thanks to Devise author and Rails committer Jos√© Valim,
  who upon my request added a set of features to Devise that made it possible
  to use Devise from an engine.

== Installation

* Edit your Gemfile or gemspec to add a dependency on the perens-instant-user gem.
* <tt>bundle update</tt>
* <tt>rake perens_instant_user:install:migrations</tt>
* <tt>rake migrate</tt>
* Edit config/routes.rb, adding this line:
    mount Perens::InstantUser::Engine => '/'
* Copy http://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/lib/generators/templates/devise.rb into config/initializers/devise.rb and edit it.
* Edit one of your environment files, like config/application.rb, to add the
  URL info to be used in email messages to users from the user management
  system. While testing, this might be:
    config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }
  but it must be set to the correct external URL when your application is
  running for
  real users.
* Add <tt>user_authenticate!</tt> and other Devise helpers to your controllers
  as appropriate. See the Devise README.rdoc[https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#readme] for information on the available features.
 
== To Do
* I'm planning to provide a web interface to set the configuration information,
  removing the need to edit configuration and environment files.
